# Sofialäktaren Tifo
My top 3 tifos created by Sofialäktaren Tifo.
Let's be honest—the football in the Swedish league isn't top-tier; Allsvenskan is currently ranked at number 24 in Europe. However, our supporters and ultras are of top-class quality. The tifos created by our Ultras are world-class. If you're not familiar with tifos, don't worry; you'll soon be aware! The goal of this website is to showcase these incredible displays to the world, with a focus on my team, Djurgårdens IF. Our Tifo Group, Sofialäktaren Tifo, is among the best in Sweden. Enjoy the ride
